[Shubham Kumar](https://shoebum.netlify.app/) lead the discussion on using OCaml with Buck2.

Additionally, Patate started a discussion about how monads unify
exceptions with regular values. They also unify IO with regular
values. My take, adding to his point, was how monads let us
parameterise the execution model - they help us detach the meaning of
computations from their representation and simply tell us what computation
depends on what. The execution model, which could be swapped, then
decides if it's an IO or error handling.

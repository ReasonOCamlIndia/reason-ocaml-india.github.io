[injuly](https://injuly.in) live coded [mini-angstrom](https://github.com/srijan-paul/mini-angstrom) drawing inspiration from both Angstrom and the Graham Hutton paper.

The agenda was

1. Short intro to parser combinators and Monads.
2. Re-implement `angstrom` from scratch – a popular parser combinator library.
3. Go through angstrom's source, and compare differences from our implementation.
4. Cover some popular Haskell parsing libraries (`parsec`, `megaparsec`, etc.)

After the meetup, [@theteachr](https://x.com/theteachr_) even [raised a pull request](https://github.com/srijan-paul/mini-angstrom/pull/2) to implement (WIP) a BenCode parser.
